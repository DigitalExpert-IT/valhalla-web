  -- in this hierarchy tableset we need calculation about user
  -- in top hierarchy tableset we need calculation about NFT perUser
  -- first hierarchy table we got list row of NFT peruser wich mean we have same row with NFT. so the calculation about user list is not eligible att all, that why we join again with hierarchy tableset because wee need calculation about user group count in this level area
  -- ok ok i know that query super creepy but it works
